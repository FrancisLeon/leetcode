Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the BST.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes v and w as the lowest node in T that has both v and w as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”
```
        _______6______
       /              \
    ___2__          ___8__
   /      \        /      \
   0      _4       7       9
         /  \
         3   5
```
For example, the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of nodes 2 and 8 is 6. Another example is LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.

Since we have to know that the parttern of the lowest ancestor, is that the children must be the 
right and left subtree. Or not, the children must be the same subtree of the ancestor.

naive solution:
- find the path to the target p, and put the ancestors in a list
- find the path to the target q, and put the ancestors in a list
- find the lowest ancestor.

where is the duplicate operations?
The duplicate path: say, target: (3, 5)
the 6->2 is the duplicate path, if we search them independantly.
