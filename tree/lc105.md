Hi guys, this is my Java solution. I read this post, which is very helpful.

The basic idea is here:
Say we have 2 arrays, PRE and IN.
Preorder traversing implies that PRE[0] is the root node.
Then we can find this PRE[0] in IN, say it's IN[5].
Now we know that IN[5] is root, so we know that IN[0] - IN[4] is on the left side, IN[6] to the end is on the right side.
Recursively doing this on subarrays, we can build a tree out of it :)

Hope this helps.

recall the solution:
```
class Solution {
    public TreeNode buildTree(int[] preorder, int[] inorder) {
        return helper(0, 0, inorder.length - 1, preorder, inorder);
    }
    
    private TreeNode helper(int preStart, int inStart, int inEnd, int[] preorder, int[] inorder) {
        if (preStart > preorder.length - 1 || inStart > inEnd) {
            return null;
        }
        
        // find the index of inorder, which is preStart of preorder.
        int index = 0;
        for (int i = inStart; i <= inEnd; i++) {
            if (inorder[i] == preorder[preStart]) {
                index = i;
                break;
            }
        }
        
        TreeNode node = new TreeNode(inorder[index]);
        node.left = helper(preStart + 1, inStart, index - 1, preorder, inorder);
        node.right = helper(preStart + index - inStart + 1, index + 1, inEnd, preorder, inorder);
        
        return node;
    }
}
```
the line:
```
node.right = helper(preStart + index - inStart + 1, index + 1, inEnd, preorder, inorder);
```
may confuse you. In fact, in this point, what we need is the root.left. In preorder, root and 
left subtree is in the left of the root.left. And in the inorder, since we find the index of root,
we know that left subtree is in the left of the root. So, the number of root and left subtree is 
index - inStart + 1. So, the index of the root.right in preorder is preStart + index - inStart + 1.
